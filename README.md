# Timesheet-GAS
Initial code for timesheet as Gsheet
A learnign experience so nothing to be proud of.  I had to discover a lot of stuf about files anf folders and moving between them, as well as some basic object maniplation. 
No doubt, in a few months, this will look unnecessarily clumsy
Distressing how much stuff you can find as code snippets that use functions now deprefctaed by Google!
Also amazing how useless a lot of the online feedback is, regularly consisting of somw variant of "why do you want to do that?"
