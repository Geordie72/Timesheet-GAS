# Timesheet-GAS
Initial code for timesheet as Gsheet
A learning experience so nothing to be proud of.  I had to discover a lot of stuff about files and folders and moving between them, as well as some basic object maniplation. 
No doubt, in a few months, this will look unnecessarily clumsy
Distressing how little decent stuff there is on the web as examples, with much stuff you find using functions now deprecated by Google!
Also amazing how useless a lot of the online feedback is, regularly consisting of some variant of "why do you want to do that?"
Also JAVA != Google script , eg whwre is 'contains' in script?
